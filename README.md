# Crazily Spinning Text

Simple CSS animation.
It looks a bit like having your text inside an
[aerotrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerotrim).

The movement may seem erratic at first sight, but it's actually quite regular.
It's just what happens when rotating an object around 3 axes simultaneously
(at different frequencies).

You can see it in action here:
